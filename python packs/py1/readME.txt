This is all the code for python packet 1.
This is where the prompts are given.

1.2
Write a program that prints the following boxes, using only five print statements: 
************ | ************ *          * | *          * *          * | *          * *          * | *          * ************ | ************
(b) Write a program that prints the following triangles, using only one print statement:
***** |     *    **** |    **     *** |   ***      ** |  ****       * | *****
N.B.  That vertical line ( | ) is called a “pipe”.  In Java, two pipes ( || ) means “OR”. 

1.3
(a) Ask the user to enter a number with lots of numbers to the right of the decimal point. Multiply the number by a 
one- or two- digit number of your choice, then display the answer rounded to two decimal places using a complete sentence. 
(b) Ask the user to enter (1) a number over 100 (but less than, say 1000), and then (2) a number under 10. 
Then tell them how many times the smaller number goes into the larger number. Use a complete sentence. 
(c) Ask the user to enter their first name in lower case. Then ask the user to enter their last name in upper case. 
Then join the two strings together and change the case to title case (using  .title()). Display the finished result.

1.4
(a) Review the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Create a Python program that does the following:  
(1) prints a 3-4 sentence introduction to one of the SDGs that you find interesting, 
(2) provides a couple of sentences (including a date) about an interesting, current (after January 1, 2020) piece of work being done on that SDG; and 
(3) saves the text in parts (1) and (2) in a variable with the name of your choice. 

(b) Use string indexes and/or string slicing with your response to part (a) above, print out the following information (provide context for each, that is, Use Part of the Question (UPQ)!): 
(1) the length of the string, 
(2) the eighth character of the string, 
(3) the last character of the string, 
(4) the first seven characters of the string, 
(5) the last nine characters of the string, 
(6) the string backwards (Hint:  use slicing with a negative interval.), 
(7) every character of the string except the last 12 characters, 
(8) every fourth character of the string, and 
(9) every character of the string except the first 20 and the last 20 characters. 

1.5
Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of at least six integers. 
Then do the following: 
(a) print out the total number of items in the list. 
(b) print out the fifth item (index 4) in the list. 
(c) print out the last three items in the list. 
(d) print out all the items in the list except the first three. 
(e) print out the list in reverse order. 
(f) print out the sum of all the values in the list. 
(g) if the list contains a zero, print out the index of the first zero in the list; otherwise print out a message saying there are no zeroes. 
(h) delete the first item from the list; print out the list that results. 
(i) change the second-to-last item in the list to 4301 and print out the new list that results. 
(j) append the value -228 to the end of the list and print out the new list that results

1.6
Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a total of at least six words—nouns, 
plural nouns, verbs, past tense verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.—and then generates a 
“mad lib”—a grammatically correct paragraph that is entertaining to read.
